regex - regular expressions

this would have been useful for what JKap was trying to do with her midterm project

examples:

Check if the pattern "ss" appears in the string "Mississippi".
Print out the 3rd word of each sentence from a list of sentences.
Find and replace all instances of "Mrs" with "Ms" in a sentence.
Does a string start with "St"?
Does a string end with "art"?
Does a string have non-alphanumeric characters in it?
Are there any whitespace characters in the string?
Find and replace all non-alphanumeric characters in a string with "-".

seems like some kind of search function

Creating regular expressions starts with the forward slash character (/). 
Inside two forward slashes you can place any characters you would like to match with the string.

We can use the =~ operator to see if we have a match in our regular expression. 
Let's say we are looking for the letter "b" in a string "powerball". Here's how we'd 
implement this using the =~ operator

"powerball" =~ /b/
=> 5
