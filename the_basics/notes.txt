Most of my notes from codeacademy are in another doc

important to remember nil means null in ruby

you can check things using .nil?

modulo vs remainder

integer.remainder(div#)
=> remainder

also .divmod() that gives both the answer AND remainder

lol so this whole modulo remainder thing basically just means avoid the problem.

I will say so far that this is fairly redundant to the codeacademy stuff
and the program says you need a background in programming but this stuff is super 
rudimentary. I guess knowing C helps.
